# solid-age-verification
Welcome to Solid Age Verification, an innovative shop application designed to ensure secure and seamless age verification using SOLID pods. This platform seeks user consent to access information stored in their personal SOLID pods. Leveraging the Authority PODs, This app securely store and validate user ages based on their unique WebIDs, ensuring a trusted and privacy-centric age verification process. With SOLID technology, it will prioritize user control over their data while guaranteeing accurate and reliable age verification for a safe shopping experience.

## Mission
At Solid Age Verification, This app mission is to revolutionize age verification in online shopping by harnessing the power of SOLID pods. To enabling a seamless, user-centric experience that prioritizes privacy and control over personal data. Through this innovative approach, we aim to establish a trusted and secure framework using Authority PODs to accurately verify user ages, ensuring compliance with age-restricted purchases while upholding the principles of transparency, security, and user empowerment within the SOLID ecosystem. Our goal is to redefine age verification, offering a solution that respects individual privacy while fostering a safe and inclusive online shopping environment.

## Roadmap
    ### Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication
        Setup and Authentication Flow
        Implement the initial Express server with SOLID authentication using solid-auth-client.
        Create routes for user login, authentication callbacks, and profile retrieval from SOLID pods.
    ### Phase 2: Authority POD Integration for Age Verification
        Authority PODs Integration
        Research and identify Authority PODs or storage mechanisms for securely storing verified user age information based on WebIDs.
        Establish connections and protocols to write and validate age data against Authority PODs.
    ### Phase 3: Age Verification Process
        Age Verification Workflow
        Define the age verification process within the application's flow, integrating SOLID pod access and Authority POD validation.
        Develop mechanisms to verify and authenticate user age information securely.
